/**
MVC Pattern stands for Model-View-Controller Pattern.
From the name we can see that the MVC pattern involves three parts:
    Model - Model represents an object carrying data. It can also have logic to update controller if its data changes.
    View - View represents the visualization of the data that model contains. Usually it has the UI logic.
    Controller - Controller references both Model and view. It controls the data flow into model object and updates the
    view whenever data changes. It keeps View and Model separate.
