/**
Prototype pattern is one of the creational patterns.
Prototype pattern helps create duplicate object with better performance.
In Prototype Pattern a clone of an existing object is returned instead of creating new one.
We use Prototype Design Pattern, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.
